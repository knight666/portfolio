_Deus Ex: Mankind Divided_ is a video game title made by [Eidos Montr√©al](https://www.deusex.com/game/dx-md?id=54e649c83c8a5e4a27c5bea5) and was released for PlayStation 4, Xbox One and Steam in August 2016. It follows the story of Adam Jensen, in a future in which augmented humans have become outcasts and are segregated from the rest of the population. The game is an action stealth adventure and is the sequel to the critically acclaimed _Deus Ex: Human Revolution_. I worked on the Steam version as a Systems Programmer, where I ensured the game was playable with mouse and keyboard just as well as with a controller.

One of the main features I worked on for the Steam version of the game was a weapons bar. This element on the HUD can be used by players to quickly switch between weapons and gadgets during gameplay. Adding it to the game took quite a bit of work. We did the design, but Eidos provided us with the artistic support. The bar touched quite a few low-level input and UI systems, which required close cooperation with Eidos to figure out how best to add it.

In the end, I am very satisified with the result. I am confident that this element improves the experience for players playing with mouse and keyboard.
