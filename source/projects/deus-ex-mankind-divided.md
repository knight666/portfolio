_Deus Ex: Mankind Divided_ is a video game title made by [Eidos Montr√©al](https://www.deusex.com/game/dx-md?id=54e649c83c8a5e4a27c5bea5) and was released for PlayStation 4, Xbox One and Steam in August 2016. It follows the story of Adam Jensen, in a future in which augmented humans have become outcasts and are segregated from the rest of the population. The game is an action stealth adventure and is the sequel to the critically acclaimed _Deus Ex: Human Revolution_. I worked on the Steam version as a Systems Programmer, where I ensured the game was playable with mouse and keyboard just as well as with a controller.
