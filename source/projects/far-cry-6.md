# Unreleased Game Mode

During my time on Far Cry 6 at Ubisoft Berlin, I worked on a game mode that was ultimately cut from the final release. I was the team lead for the feature for about nine months, helping a multi-disciplinary team to realize their vision for this game mode.

As a lead, my responsibilities included making sure the production was running smoothly, the team members were happy, and interfacing with the lead studio. I even managed to get some UI programming in myself.

The team had a lot of freedom to iterate on the design, which helped to improve the game mode over time. We used regular internal tests to see if the game mode was progressing.

Ultimately, a decision was made to cancel the game mode and pool the resources on other aspects of the game.

# HUD

As a UI programmer, I created a system for managing the visiblity of HUD elements and menu screens. Dunia, the engine that runs Far Cry, makes a hard distinction between the two types of UI. Menu screens are able to accept user input while HUD elements cannot. Part of our experimentation was to see if we could create a HUD element that could still accept user input.
