		<h2>About me</h2>
		<p>My name is Quinten Lansu and I'm a 26-year old programmer, living and working in the Netherlands. I've always been interested in games and game development, which is why I studied <em>International Game Architecture and Design</em> at the NHTV in Breda, the Netherlands. I've been working as a professional game developer since 2013, when I joined the ranks of Nixxes Software in Utrecht.</p>
