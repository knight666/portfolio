				<h1>About me</h1>
			</div>
			<div class="text">
				<p>I started my career in game development with Game Maker, all the way back in 2002. I shipped my first game in 2004, when I was just 14 years old. It wasn't exactly a commercial success though, since I released the game for free on the Internet.</p>
				<p>After studying International Game Architecture and Design at NHTV University for Applied Sciences, I joined the ranks of Nixxes Software in 2013, where I worked on the user interface for games like <a href="projects/deus-ex-mankind-divided.html">Deus Ex: Mankind Divided</a> and <a href="projects/rise-of-the-tomb-raider.html">Rise of the Tomb Raider</a>.</p>
				<p>However, I felt like a big fish in a small pond after a while. I moved to Berlin to seek out new opportunities, which I found in the free-to-play game <a href="projects/game-of-thrones-seven-kingdoms.html">Game of Thrones: Seven Kingdoms</a>.</p>
				<p>I've realized that what I enjoy most about working on user interfaces is getting feedback directly from players and/or users. Working on computer graphics is nice, but I'd rather leave the math to the experts.</p>
				<p>I also love to work closely with artists and designers. I approach my role as a facilitator: I help them figure out what is possible and work to breathe life into their designs and sketches. And I'm always eager to learn more about how they approach tricky design requirements.</p>
				<p>Even though I do most of my work in C++ or C#, Iâ€™m not afraid to get my hands dirty with Python, Javascript or visual scripting either. I built this portfolio from scratch myself in vanilla Javascript, if you can believe it.</p>
