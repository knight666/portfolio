During my tenure at Ubisoft Berlin, I spearheaded the development of a game mode for Far Cry 6. Although this mode didn't make it to the final release, my leadership as the team lead for this feature spanned over nine months. I was instrumental in helping a diverse team bring their vision to life, ensuring smooth production, team satisfaction, and effective communication with the lead studio. And on some days, I even found the time to contribute to UI programming.

The team had a lot of freedom to iterate on the design, which helped to improve the game mode quickly. We used regular internal tests with user researchers to see if the game mode was progressing in the right direction.

# HUD

As a UI programmer, I created a system for managing the visibility of HUD elements and menu screens. Dunia, the engine that runs _Far Cry_, makes a hard distinction between the two types of UI. Menu screens can accept user input, while HUD elements cannot. Part of our experimentation was to see if we could create a HUD element that would receive user input. This experiment helped to improve the HUD system for the whole game.
