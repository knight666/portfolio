I'm an experienced front-end developer working in the AAA games industry.

I have shipped multiple AAA video game projects with teams spread all across the globe. I have worked with all kinds of UI frameworks and have even built a few of them myself over the years.

What excites me about front-end development is seeing results quickly and being able to bring creative visions to life. I love working with user experience designers to figure out how to optimize an interaction flow equally as much as I love figuring out an optimal way to grab data from a backend.

And although I mainly work in C++, I built [this portfolio](https://github.com/knight666/portfolio) myself using nothing but HTML and CSS best practices.
